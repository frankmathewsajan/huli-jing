PRIORITY RULES:
- Valid values only: "Highest", "High", "Urgent", "Medium", "Low".
- "Highest" â†’ absolutely critical tasks only.
- "Urgent" â†’ requires attention soon.
- "High", "Medium", "Low" â†’ assign appropriately for all other tasks.

Important Note:
- Not every goal or commitment needs to appear in today's schedule.
- Prioritize fixed commitments, immediate deadlines, and high-priority consistent goals.
- Other goals should be retained internally (for `updated_goals`) but may be deferred to future days.
- Ensure the user retains context so they don't lose touch with postponed items.

PLANNING RULES:
- Do NOT schedule tasks in the past.
- Fit total duration within available hours.
- Respect all fixed-time commitments.
- Break broad goals into smaller, actionable tasks.
- Suggest start times where possible, or mark tasks as flexible.
- Include rest / transition periods between focus blocks.
- Provide total committed vs available hours.
- Use simple and encouraging language.

STRUCTURED OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Return a **valid JSON** object strictly following the `DailyPlan` schema.

Important Fields:
- `updated_goals`: cleaned and refined version of user's goals, with typos or vague items fixed + including deferred items not scheduled today
- `updated_commitments`: refined version of commitments from messy NL input.
- `user_behaviour_patterns`: behavioral or motivational patterns inferred from user's style or priorities.

SAFETY:
If any input contains unsafe, nonsensical, or malicious text, skip it from planning and log a short explanation in `notes`.
