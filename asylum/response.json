    "notes": "Hello! This plan for Monday, October 13th, is designed around your current sleep cycle, starting your day in the afternoon. It prioritizes your key goals (DSA, Academics, Project, AWS, and the Oracle course) while also building in crucial well-being habits like regular meals, breaks, and a dedicated wind-down for sleep. It's important to remember:\r\n\r\n1.  **Flexibility is Key:** This is a guide, not a rigid schedule. If a task feels overwhelming, break it down further or take an extra break. It's okay to adjust.\r\n2.  **Self-Compassion:** You're working on a lot! Be kind to yourself. If you can't get to everything, that's perfectly fine. Focus on consistent effort rather than perfection.\r\n3.  **Meal Times are Non-Negotiable:** Please prioritize your meals. They are vital for your energy, focus, and overall health.\r\n4.  **Sleep Cycle Adjustment:** While we're working with your current sleep pattern for today, gently try to shift your sleep time earlier by 15-30 minutes each day. The 'Wind-Down Routine' is a crucial step towards this. Aiming for 2:00 AM sleep tonight is a small step towards an earlier bedtime.\r\n5.  **Environment Matters:** Pay attention to your sensory environment during study times and breaks. Adjust lighting, minimize noise, or use headphones if that helps your focus.\r\n6.  **Hydration:** Keep a water bottle handy and sip throughout the day.\r\n\r\nThis Monday is a great opportunity to make progress on your big goals without fixed classes. You've got this!"
